Alamano Nextbots have been moved from Workshop to Github due to unforeseen circumstances

Follow these steps in order to install:
1) Open Steam and navigate to your Library
2) Scroll through your list of games on the left side bar until you find Garry's Mod
3) Right click Garry's Mod and navigate to "Browse local files" (Manage > Browse local files)
4) Navigate to the addons folder(Garry's Mod root folder/garrysmod/addons) and extract the contents of the rar there

It won't appear in your addons list, but it's there. Once you're in the game, navigate to NPCs, then to Nextbots, and you will find the Alamano NPC there.
Have fun!
